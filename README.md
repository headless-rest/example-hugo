## Hugo example

Example Hugo project with Headless integration.

This project uses Hugo tags to insert data directly into the layout. See `layouts/index.html`.

You may also consider using the markdown approach, which downloads content from the Content API and creates `.md` files in the right directory. See the `example-hexo` project on how to do this.

## Development

Start this Hugo project with `hugo server -D`
